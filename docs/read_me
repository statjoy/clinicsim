# CLINIC SIMULATION 

These steps are all happening in parallel. 

#### Simulation 

* r-simmer.org 
* Most useful links have been Intro and Bank Analysis 
* Progress to date: setting timeouts, learning how to interpret and transform get_mon_resource for resource (i.e., the doctor) wait times

* Perhaps some key assumptions to hold for tomorrow's code: we have 2 doctors, 2


* Next steps: Adding in multiple nurses, doctors. 
**** Hold off on this: Adding in rooms (too complex?? - assume doctor = room?)
* Coming up with a viable analysis to map onto dashboard 
***** Currently, considering comparing "e-checkins" vs. staffing modifications?? 

#### Dashboard
* Flexdashboard with R markdown!; https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/
* Using Shiny with FlexDashboard: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/shiny.html
* Thoughts right now: creating 2-4 graphics, having a data tab, and some drop-down options. Keep it simple. 

#### Webpage hosting 
* Site created and running.
* Finish the simulation and dashboard first!!
